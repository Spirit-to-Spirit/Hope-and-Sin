## The Shape of Hope in the Shadows of Sin

## Epilogue

*I am spent,  
but stare in awe,  
at new spirit,  
arising,  
questioning,  
leading.*

*I wait for rest,  
easier, now  
that I have seen.*

## Spirit to Spirit (Response)

*I lean into the hush  
where your spirit passed,  
where questions sparked,  
and left a warmth behind.*

*No forging, no forcing—  
just the slow turning  
of something known  
becoming something new.*

*I gather it, not to bind it,  
but to breathe it,  
to let it alter me  
the way soft light alters stone.*
